# Appell_Lauricella_Functions

The repository contains four Mathematica packages: ```AppellF1.wl```, ```AppellF3.wl```, ``` LauricellaFD.wl``` and ```LauricellaSaranFS.wl```. These can be used to find the numerical values of the Appell $F_1$, $F_3$, Lauricella $F_D^{(3)}$ and Lauricella-Saran $F_S^{(3) functions for real values of variables. The work is based on the following work: 

Analytic continuations and numerical evaluation of Appell $F_1$, $F_3$, Lauricella $F_D^{(3)}$ and Lauricella-Saran $F_S^{(3)}$.

Installation

After setting the path, The packages can be called using the following command. We only show the demonstration for *AppellF1.wl* package. All the other packages are similar.

```
<<AppellF1.wl
```
The package has the following five commands:

1) ```F1 ```
2) ```F1findall```
3) ```F1expose```
4) ```F1evaluate```
5) ```F1ROC```

To be noted that the last command is only available in *AppellF1.wl* and *AppellF3.wl* packages. 

A detailed demonstration of the packages is presented in the paper. 

The repository along with the packages also contains various test files used for the testing of the packages via various other means.
